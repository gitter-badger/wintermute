 * @class Factory
 * @brief Handles the loading and manufactoring of plug-ins.
 *
 * In the core module state, plug-ins are loaded in the following fashion:
 *
 *  - Grab metadata: Obtain the plug-in's meta information, as much as
 *  possible. At the moment, the only two bits of data we'd need is the
 *  version of the plug-in and the ABI version. This is how we determine
 *  whether or not loading this plug-in would cause a loading issue.
 *
 *  - Check ABI: Determine whether or not this plug-in will work properly in
 *  this version of Wintermute. Simple decimal number comparison.
 *
 *  - Load binary: Loads the binary.
