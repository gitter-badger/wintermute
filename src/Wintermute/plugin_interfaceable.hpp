 * @class Wintermute::PluginInterface
 *
 * This interface provides libraries that wish to be manipulated by
 * Wintermute to have a direct proxy into the application. As opposed to the
 * classical approach of having libraries define the Wintermute::Plugin
 * directly and resolve its symbol, we require this to be the object in
 * question for resolution and implementation.
 * This object serves as a proxy between the library defined and the
 * Wintermute application running this application. It provides all of the
 * necessary aspects of manipulating and toggling the library and is meant
 * to be small in feature set.
