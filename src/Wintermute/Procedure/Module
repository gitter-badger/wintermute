/**
 * Modules are two-fold object. They serve as a server that sends out
 * information about signals emission and method return values and as clients
 * that request methods to be invoked and subscribe to signal emission logic.
 *
 * Everything expects all of the work to be done locally. Thus, the primary
 * socket that Wintermute listens for activity is on a local socket. The
 * location of this socket has yet to be determined.
 *
 * Keeping in mind that Wintermute itself only provides the parallel
 * processing nature required to upkeep itself, each process can be considered
 * a 'node'. Each node would listen over a general local socket in order
 * to communicate with one another, like a watering hole. This socket is
 * typically named '/tmp/wintermute/waterhole.socket'. Also, each module is
 * designed to listen and send messages over TCP as well, but this can be
 * tweaked on a per-module, per-process basis.
 *
 * ## SUPPORT PLUG-INS
 * A few plug-ins are added to facilitate the procedure calling flow.
 *
 * (watchdog): allow modules to provide a 'heartbeat'; a ping every half
 * minute to determine whether or not they are still active on the network.
 * This allows for more accurate module detection and health reporting.
 *
 * (relay): Modules are meant to be run locally. What 'relay' does is takes
 * the output of each message sent and relays over another protocol. By
 * itself, this plug-in can't do much as it serves as a hub for protocol
 * implementations to hook in but work for HTTP and serial sockets.
