/**
 * @class Wintermute::Procedure::Message
 * @brief Basis of data transfer in RPC for Wintermute.
 *
 * This class serves as the basis for data, 'packets' if you will, for
 * Wintermute's RPC. It's meant to be used as a foundation for serializing
 * data like `Call` or `Signal` objects or so that they can be used over any
 * compatible medium.
 *
 * `Message` is registered into Qt's QMetaType system so that you can use it
 * wherever you'd use QVariant; for quick serializing across the board.
