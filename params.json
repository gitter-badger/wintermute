Describing it in a single line would be unfair\r\nfor the project too, so I [wrote a blog post about it][blogpost].

Instructions for [testing][] \r\nand [contributing][] are also provided. Wintermute currently depends on \r\n[Qt 4.8.4][qt] and [CMake][].\r\n\r\n**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.**\r\n\r\n[blogpost]: http://jalcine.me\r\n[installing]: ./INSTALLING.markdown\r\n[testing]: ./TESTING.markdown\r\n[contributing]: ./CONTRIBUTING.markdown\r\n[qt]: http://qt-project.org/downloads\r\n[cmake]: http://cmake.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
