The application is written in C++ at \r\nits core but hopes are made to extend the platform to work with **Ruby**, \r\n**Python**, **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Scala**, **Lua**, **Haskell** and\r\n**Go** (not in that exact order!). It'd be awesome!\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nInstalling? **Easy**. We use [CMake](http://cmake.org); we gotcha. But read\r\n[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Tested Operating Systems\r\nSo far, Wintermute has only been built and tested on a Linux operating system,\r\nmore precisely, running [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org) Raring Ringtail 13.04.\r\nPlease build, test and upload your results for comparsion!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n - Fork, make a topic branch and propose your changes! **Bonus points for using Waffle**\r\n - Build and test Wintermute on a foreign, untested system!\r\n - Spread the word and do your part to make Wintermute an awesome app!\r\n\r\nI *strongly* recommend using tools like\r\n[`git-flow`](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and\r\n[`git-hooks`](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks) to accelerate your\r\ndevelopment process.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're adding a new feature, try writing a test\r\nfor it first!\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nI (the project maintainer, Jacky Alcine) do my best to answer any and all \r\nquestions pertaining to Wintermute. You can e-mail me at me@jalcine.me or \r\nfind me on IRC on Freenode, OFTC or the Perl servers with the nick\r\n`jalcine` or `Jacky`.\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nWintermute is licensed under the GPLv2 license.
