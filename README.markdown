# Wintermute

Wintermute's a weird project. Describing it in a single line would be unfair
for the project too, so I [wrote a blog post about it][blogpost]. This project
is the maintained sources for `libwintermutecore`and `wintermute-driver`.
See the [docs about this](./doc/LibraryAsCore.markdown) For installation 
instructions, view the [INSTALLING][] file. Instructions for [testing][] 
and [contributing][] are also provided. Wintermute currently depends on 
[Qt 4.8.4][qt] and [CMake][].

**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.**
