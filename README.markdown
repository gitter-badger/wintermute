# Wintermute

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/libwintermutecore.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/libwintermutecore)

Wintermute's a pet project (for about four years now). Describing it in a
single concise sentence would be unfair to it so [I wrote a incomplete
post][blogpost] about it. This repository holds the sources for just the core
library, `libwintermutecore`but I plan to add the driver executable in the
future, as soon as the library's down and tested.

This project just needs `jsoncpp`, `log4cxx`, `cmake` and a C++ compiler that
supports and implements the C+11 standards.

**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.**
