# Wintermute [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute.png)](http://waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/jalcine/wintermute/badge.png?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/r/jalcine/wintermute?branch=develop) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/wintermute.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/wintermute)

**Wintermute** is meant to be an application platform that aims to:
  + extend by means of plug-ins and RPC
  + embrace the mannerisms of parallel computing
  + works on desktops, mobile devices and embedded platforms
  + increases its functionality on demand

This repository has been my tinkering to get the platform as close to
ideally fit as possibly capable by [me](http://jalcine.me).

Installing? **Easy**. We use [CMake](http://cmake.org); we gotcha. But read
[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for more information.

## Notes
**Wintermute** itself is built using the [Qt4 framework](http://qt-project.org).
It also uses a few C++11 features like lambdas so it's recommended that you
build with either `clang` or `gcc >= 4.7`.

## Tested Operating Systems
So far, Wintermute has only been built and tested on a Linux operating system,
more precisely, running [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org) Raring Ringtail 13.04.
Please build, test and upload your results for comparison!

## Contributing

 - Fork, make a topic branch and propose your changes! **Bonus points for using Waffle**
 - Build and test Wintermute on a foreign, untested system!
 - Spread the word and do your part to make Wintermute an awesome app!

I *strongly* recommend using tools like
[`git-flow`](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and
[`git-hooks`](https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks) to accelerate your
development process.

Also, if you're adding a new feature, try writing a test
for it first!
