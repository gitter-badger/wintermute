**Wintermute** is meant to be an application platform that aims to:
  + extend by means of plug-ins and RPC
  + embrace the mannerisms of parallel computing
  + works on desktops, mobile devices and embedded platforms
  + increases its functionality on demand

This repository has been my tinkering to get the application as close to
ideally fit as possibly capable by [me](http://jalcine.me).

Installing? **Easy**. We use [CMake](http://cmake.org); we gotcha. But read
[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for more information.

## Notes
**Wintermute** itself is built using the [Qt4 framework][].
It also uses a few C++11 features like lambdas so it's recommended that you
build with either `clang >= 3.5-1~exp1` or `gcc >= 4.8.1`.

## Tested Operating Systems
So far, Wintermute has only been built and tested on a Linux operating system,
more precisely, running [Kubuntu][] Raring Ringtail 13.04.
Please build, test and upload your results for comparison!

**Update**: Also builds fine on [Kubuntu][] Saucy Salamander 13.10.
## Contributing

 - Fork, make a topic branch and propose your changes! **Bonus points for using Waffle**
 - Build and test Wintermute on a foreign, untested system!
 - Spread the word and do your part to make Wintermute an awesome app!

I *strongly* recommend using tools like [`git-flow`][] and [`git-hooks`][] to 
accelerate your development process on the source control side.

Also, if you're adding a new feature, try writing a test for it first! 
Wintermute has a few wrappers over Qt's testing tools. If you get stuck,
copy one of the existing tests and tweak it to your needs.

## Support

I (the project maintainer, Jacky Alcin√©) do my best to answer any and all
questions pertaining to Wintermute. You can e-mail me at me@jalcine.me or 
find me on IRC on Freenode, OFTC or the Perl servers with the nick
`jalcine` or `Jacky`. You can also use [Gitter][] to chat about the project.
